# Python Projects

  This contains beginner to intermediate-level Python projects that demonstrate practical applications of programming concepts, data analysis, and visualization. It includes a card drawing game using object-oriented programming, and an interactive dashboard built with Jupyter Notebook for analyzing vessel discharge data. These projects showcase Python skills such as class design, data manipulation with pandas, data visualization using Plotly and Seaborn, as well as the use of interactive widgets for enhanced user experience.

# 1. Vessel Discharge Dashboard

  The Vessel Discharge Dashboard is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization project developed in Jupyter Notebook using Python. It leverages a dataset of vessel discharge records based on previous work experiences, wherein the data has been manipulated to maintain confidentiality. It provides users with interactive tools to explore cargo volume trends across vessels, ports, and months. Using libraries such as pandas, plotly, matplotlib, seaborn, and ipywidgets, the project includes dynamic summary cards, bar and line charts, pie charts, and heatmaps. Users can filter the data using dropdown widgets to focus on specific vessels or time periods. The dashboard highlights key metrics like total voyages, cargo breakdowns by type, top consignees, and the busiest vessels. This project showcases intermediate-level data processing, interactive UI elements in Jupyter, and modern data visualization techniques.

# 2. Card Drawing Game

  The Card Drawing Game is a simple command-line Python program that simulates drawing cards from a small deck using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It features a custom Card class to represent individual cards and a Deck class to manage a collection of cards across four suits and four ranks. When executed, the program allows users to draw cards one at a time, displaying the result in a clean, readable format. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of OOP such as encapsulation and class relationships, making it ideal for beginners who want to understand class structure and object interaction in Python. It requires no external libraries and runs entirely on the standard Python interpreter.
